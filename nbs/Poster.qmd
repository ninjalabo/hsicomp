## Introduction

### Objective:
To improve hyperspectral image analysis by integrating SSCNet [1] with the FasterAI [4] compression technique, demonstrating efficiency and performance on the HySpecNet-11k dataset. Hyperspectral imaging provides rich spectral information across numerous bands, supporting applications like remote sensing, agriculture, and medical imaging. However, the high volume and computational demands of hyperspectral data necessitate innovative compression and processing techniques.

### Challenges:

* Managing large-scale hyperspectral datasets.
* Balancing reconstruction quality and compression efficiency.

### Contribution:

* Adapted SSCNet from HySpecNet-11k.
* Applied FasterAI for compressing hyperspectral data.
* Achieved a practical balance of compression and computational performance.



## Methodology

### Dataset: HySpecNet-11k

HySpecNet-11k [2] is a large-scale hyperspectral dataset containing 11,483 image patches (128×128 pixels with 224 spectral bands) derived from e Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite data. It is designed for benchmarking learning-based compression and analysis methods.

* Dataset Splits: Training (70%), Validation (20%), Test (10%).
* Preprocessing: Removed water vapor-affected bands, applied normalization, and used both patchwise and tilewise splits.


### Model: Spectral Signals Compressor Network (SSCNet)
SSCNet [3] uses 2D convolutions to compress spatial dimensions while preserving spectral integrity.

* Encoder: Three 2D convolutional layers with parametric ReLU activation and max-pooling.
* Decoder: Uses transposed convolutions for reconstruction.
* Advantages: Efficient compression with a fixed compression ratio.

### FasterAI Compression:

* Quantization: Reduced bit precision to minimize memory.
* Pruning: Removed redundant parameters while preserving core model functionality.
* Integration: FasterAI compresses SSCNet post-training, optimizing it for deployment without sacrificing accuracy.


## Experimental Results


* SSCNet achieves efficient spectral-spatial compression with competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
* FasterAI’s compression significantly reduces model size with minimal loss in PSNR.

### Performance Metrics:

* Compression Ratio: Achieved up to 80% reduction in model size.
* Accuracy Retention: Maintained high Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) (~43.64 dB).
* Inference Efficiency: Substantial reduction in computation time.

### Qualitative Analysis:

* Visuals demonstrate minimal loss of fidelity in reconstructed hyperspectral images.


## Conclusion

Our integration of SSCNet with FasterAI compression demonstrates an effective balance of high-quality reconstruction, significant compression, and computational efficiency for hyperspectral imaging tasks.

Impact:

* Enables practical deployment of hyperspectral models in resource-constrained environments.
* Supports scalable analysis for large datasets like HySpecNet-11k.

## Future Work:

* Test FasterAI compression on additional hyperspectral models.
* Explore dynamic compression techniques for real-time applications.
