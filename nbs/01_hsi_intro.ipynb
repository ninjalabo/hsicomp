    "# HYPER SPECTRAL IMAGING \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an advanced imaging technique that captures a wide spectrum of light beyond basic colors (RGB: red, green, blue) that the human eye can see. Unlike standard cameras, which record only three bands of light, hyperspectral cameras can capture hundreds of bands of light, covering a broader spectrum, often from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). Each band represents a specific wavelength range, giving detailed information about the spectral properties of the scene or object.\n"
