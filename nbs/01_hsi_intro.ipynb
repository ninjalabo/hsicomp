    "# HYPER SPECTRAL IMAGING: INTRO\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an advanced imaging technique that captures a wide spectrum of light beyond basic colors (RGB: red, green, blue) that the human eye can see. Unlike standard cameras, which record only three bands of light, hyperspectral cameras can capture hundreds of bands of light, covering a broader spectrum, often from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). Each band represents a specific wavelength range, giving detailed information about the spectral properties of the scene or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference Between HSI and RGB\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Resolution: RGB imaging captures three broad wavelength bands corresponding to red, green, and blue. In contrast, HSI captures light in many very narrow bands over a wide range of wavelengths. This high spectral resolution allows for the detection of fine spectral differences that are not possible with RGB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Dimensionality: RGB images are typically composed of three layers or channels, whereas HSI data is multi-dimensional, containing potentially hundreds of layers corresponding to different spectral bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Compression Techniques for Hyperspectral Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pruning\n",
    "Pruning removes less significant weights or neurons in a neural network, reducing model size and computational load.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight Pruning: Removes individual, low-magnitude weights, making the model sparse. For HSI models, this is effective in reducing the storage requirement, especially in fully connected and convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Pruning: Removes entire channels, filters, or layers, which is useful for maintaining the structure of hyperspectral data and is easier to deploy in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use in HSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is especially beneficial for HSI models with deep convolutional architectures, where spatial and spectral feature extraction across hundreds of channels can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "It helps retain important spectral features while discarding redundant filters or neurons that contribute less to model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization reduces the precision of weights and activations (e.g., from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integer), decreasing memory and computation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Quantization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Quantization: All weights and activations are uniformly quantized, effective for simple HSI classification tasks.\n",
    "Non-Uniform Quantization: Uses a non-uniform distribution to better preserve important spectral and spatial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in HSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization is particularly useful when deploying models on edge devices (e.g., drones and satellites) where power efficiency and memory are limited.\n",
    "It reduces latency in processing hyperspectral cubes while retaining spectral accuracy, which is critical for applications like crop monitoring or mineral exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knowledge Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge Distillation involves training a smaller “student” model to replicate the behavior of a larger “teacher” model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The teacher model, typically a large HSI network trained with extensive spectral data, provides “soft labels” or intermediate feature maps that guide the student model.\n",
    "The student model learns from these outputs, resulting in a lightweight model with nearly comparable accuracy to the teacher model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in HSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge distillation is highly effective for creating smaller, efficient models that perform well in spectral classification tasks and material identification.\n",
    "It is advantageous when deploying hyperspectral models in environments with limited computational resources, such as real-time monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Low-Rank Factorization\n",
    "Low-Rank Factorization decomposes the large weight matrices of the neural network into smaller, low-rank matrices, reducing the number of parameters and speeding up computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in HSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly effective for convolutional layers in HSI, where large filter sizes are common.\n",
    "It enables efficient spectral-spatial feature extraction by decomposing filters into simpler operations, which helps with real-time data processing needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse Regularization\n",
    "Sparse Regularization techniques enforce sparsity in model weights during training by adding a regularization term reducing storage requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in HSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse regularization is useful for hyperspectral models that operate on limited-band subsets, retaining critical spectral information while reducing parameter count.\n",
    "This is especially helpful when dealing with high-dimensional HSI data, where sparsity reduces redundancy across similar spectral bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Considerations & Challenges in Model Compression for HSI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintaining Spectral Integrity and Features\n",
    "Compressing HSI models must be done with care to avoid losing spectral details essential for tasks like material classification or anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balancing Compression and Accuracy\n",
    "For HSI, achieving the right balance between model size and accuracy is key, especially in scientific applications where spectral accuracy cannot be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-Time Deployment Case\n",
    "Hyperspectral models often need to process data in real-time on edge devices. Compression techniques like quantization and pruning are critical for achieving low latency in applications like disaster monitoring or agricultural mapping.\n",
